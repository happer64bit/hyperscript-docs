## Using Environment Variables in Syntax

In your YAML configuration file, you can use placeholders for environment variables with the following syntax:

```yaml
{{VARIABLE_NAME}}
```

When the configuration is processed, `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` will be replaced with the value of the environment variable `VARIABLE_NAME`.

## Example Configuration

Here's an example of a YAML configuration file using environment variables:

```yaml
global:
  url: https://{{API_HOST}}
  headers:
    Authorization: Bearer {{API_TOKEN}}
  cookies:
    session_id: {{SESSION_ID}}

run:
  - name: Get All Cars
    path: /api/v1/cars
    expect:
      contentType: application/json
      status: 200

  - name: Get Single Car
    path: /api/v1/cars/1
    expect:
      contentType: application/json
      status:
        - value: 200
        - value: 201
      contains:
        id: 1
      lessThan:
        price: 30000
      greaterThan:
        year: 2010
      body:
        make: Toyota
        model: Corolla
        color: Silver
```

In this example:

- `{{API_HOST}}` will be replaced with the value of the `API_HOST` environment variable.
- `{{API_TOKEN}}` will be replaced with the value of the `API_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `{{SESSION_ID}}` will be replaced with the value of the `SESSION_ID` environment variable.

## Setting Environment Variables

Before running your tests, ensure you have set the necessary environment variables. You can set environment variables in your terminal or command prompt.

### On Unix-based Systems (Linux, macOS)

```bash
export API_HOST=freetestapi.com
export API_TOKEN=your_token_here
export SESSION_ID=your_session_id_here
```

### On Windows

```cmd
set API_HOST=freetestapi.com
set API_TOKEN=your_token_here
set SESSION_ID=your_session_id_here
```
