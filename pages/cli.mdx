## Command-Line Interface (CLI) Guide

The **Test Runner** provides a command-line interface (CLI) to manage and execute tests. Below is a guide on how to use the CLI commands effectively.

### Command Syntax

```bash
hyperscript <path-to-your-config-file> [--skip-error]
```

### Options

- `<path-to-your-config-file>`: Specifies the path to the YAML configuration file that contains the test settings and parameters. Replace this placeholder with the actual path to your file.

- `--skip-error` (Optional): When included, this flag will skip errors and continue executing the tests even if some tests fail. Omitting this option will stop the execution on errors.

### Examples

#### Running Tests with Default Behavior

```bash
hyperscript /path/to/config.yaml
```

This command runs the tests as specified in `/path/to/config.yaml`. If any test fails, the process will halt and display the error.

#### Running Tests and Skipping Errors

```bash
hyperscript /path/to/config.yaml --skip-error
```

This command runs the tests and continues even if some tests fail. Errors will be reported, but the execution will not stop.

### Output

The CLI will display test results and status updates as follows:

- **Success**: Test results are highlighted in green, indicating that the test passed successfully.

- **Failure**: Test results are highlighted in red, indicating that the test failed. Detailed error messages will include the method and URL of the failed request.

### Additional Help

For more information about the CLI commands, you can use:

```bash
hyperscript --help
```

This command will display a help message with details on usage and options.
