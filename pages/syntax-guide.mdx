## Syntax Guide

### YAML Configuration File Structure

```yaml
global:
  url: "https://example.com/api"
  headers:
    Content-Type: "application/json"
  cookies:
    session_id: "abc123"
```

- **`global:`**: This section contains global settings that apply to all tests.
  - **`url:`**: The base URL for API requests. Replace `"https://example.com/api"` with your API's base URL.
  - **`headers:`**: Default headers for all requests. Here, `Content-Type: "application/json"` specifies that requests should include this header.
  - **`cookies:`**: Default cookies for all requests. `session_id: "abc123"` is an example of a cookie.

```yaml
run:
  - name: "Test Example 1"
    path: "/endpoint1"
    method: "GET"
    expect:
      status: 200
      contentType: "application/json"
      body:
        key1: "value1"
```

- **`run:`**: A list of individual test cases.
  - **`- name:`**: The name of this test case. `"Test Example 1"` is a descriptive name.
  - **`path:`**: The specific endpoint path to append to the base URL. `"/endpoint1"` is the path for this test.
  - **`method:`**: The HTTP method to use for this request. `"GET"` is used in this example.
  - **`expect:`**: Expected results for this test case.
    - **`status:`**: The expected HTTP status code. `200` indicates a successful request.
    - **`contentType:`**: Expected content type in the response headers. `"application/json"` specifies that the response should be in JSON format.
    - **`body:`**: Expected JSON response body. `key1: "value1"` is the expected content.

```yaml
  - name: "Test Example 2"
    path: "/endpoint2"
    method: "POST"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer token"
    cookies:
      session_id: "xyz789"
    expect:
      status: 201
      contentType: "application/json"
      body:
        key2: "value2"
```

- **Second Test Case**:
  - **`- name:`**: The name of this test case. `"Test Example 2"` is used here.
  - **`path:`**: The endpoint path for this test. `"/endpoint2"` is used in this test.
  - **`method:`**: The HTTP method. `"POST"` is used in this example.
  - **`headers:`**: Headers specific to this test case. `Authorization: "Bearer token"` adds an authorization header.
  - **`cookies:`**: Cookies specific to this test case. `session_id: "xyz789"` is used here.
  - **`expect:`**: Expected results for this test case.
    - **`status:`**: Expected HTTP status code. `201` indicates that the request was successful and a resource was created.
    - **`contentType:`**: Expected content type in the response headers. `"application/json"` specifies JSON format.
    - **`body:`**: Expected JSON response body. `key2: "value2"` is the expected content.

### Notes

- **Indentation**: YAML uses indentation to define structure. Use spaces, not tabs, for indentation.
- **Value Formatting**: Ensure values, especially JSON objects, are correctly formatted.
